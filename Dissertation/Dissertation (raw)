# Acknowledgements
I would like to take the opportunity to thank the artefact's community members whom have supported me for the past 7 years. It is thanks to their encouragement that I have successfully created this study's artefact, which will go on the form the basis of a long term personal endeavour. In particular, I would like to give extra thanks to Ben for following development since 2017 and 4DEntity for agreeing to assist in acquiring study participants.
Additionally, I would also like to Khaled for his guidance throughout the project. His advice and insight has made the project substantially more managable for me, despite various setbacks.
